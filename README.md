## Introduction
Kinemium Engine is an engine (duh) that imitates roblox's API Surface, this means you can develop roblox-style syntax in this engine and it will work normally!<br>
It was originally to test zune's capabilities on raylib, but now, it has expanded to a full on independent engine.

# Features
Here are all its services:
- Debris
- HttpService
- Lighting
- Players
- ReplicatedStorage
- RunService
- StarterGui
- TweenService
- UserInputService
- Workspace

# Kinemium's Services
- FontService
- PhysicsService
- ShaderService
- ModService<br>
*All custom services start with Kinemium.*

# That's cool.. But how do I use this?
Fortunately theres a tutorial:

- Clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/Qquaded/Kinemium-Engine.git```

- Get zune *(skip this step if you have it already installed.)*<br>
https://zune.sh/guides/install

- Run the engine<br>
```zune run game```<br>
*This tutorial works with Windows only. Linux support is coming soon.*

# How do I add scripts?
Once you clone the github repo, you will find a folder called ```sandboxed``` inside the engine *(src)*<br>
There are a set of predefined scripts in there as examples, but you can change any of them.

# Can I make my games have modding support?
Yes! there is a modding service called KinemiumModService (said up there)<br>
This lets you add mods to your game, and you can set the enviroment of your said mods!

# How do I spell Kinemium?
Ki-nem-yum!!
